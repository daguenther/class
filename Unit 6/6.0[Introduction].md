# Big Idea

Building on an understanding of similar angles comes similar shapes. We will explore this in this unit, paying attention to shapes that are similar to others, and what makes them similar.

# Project

The company you submitted your draft to called back, and they really like it! But in order to build the house, they need scale diagrams. Crate a floor plan to scale, with both the scale measurement, and the constructed house measurement [for all rooms in the house and items] (as in, will you have sofas, and how large will they be?)
