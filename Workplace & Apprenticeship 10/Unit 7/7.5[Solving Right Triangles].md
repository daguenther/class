# Start

## Intro

Now we're going to put all this information together. We know about SOH CAH TOA, and we know about the Pythagoras theorem. There is one more piece of information that may come in handy, and I believe you may already know it.

All triangles have 180 degrees, which means that if you know 2 angles, you can find out the third. Then once you know all angles, all you need is one side to start calculating the others.

The following are some equations that are used in higher level math, but are none the less usefull to use.

This course doesn't get into it, but if you would like to research it, I would gladely answer any questions you have.

Just remember that small letters are usually sides (a,b,c) and angles are large letters (A,B,C)
