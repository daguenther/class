# Big Idea

We ended the last unit coming to some situations about similar triangles, but the world of triangles, and particularly right triangles, is quite large. There are a bunch of really neat things to learn about how these mysterious figures work together.

# Project

Using your new found skills, figure out the diagonal size of 3 different screens. You will need to show me the angles created from the transfersal, and the challenge is such: you may not use a protractor.
