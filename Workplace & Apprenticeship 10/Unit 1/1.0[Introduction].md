# Big Idea

You will learn skills necessary for working with money in the workplace.

# Project

So here's your first project:

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find out how much money you need to spend to eat everything that you do.

Don't worry if you can't do this right now, I am going to provide tools necessary for you to do this task.

Step 1 due September 5: Find out everything eaten in one day, including the unit price of all products eaten, and an approximation of how much you ate of the product

Step 2 due September 12: Find any sales deals, and have all calculations done

Example with Garlic cloves

**Everything Due September 19**
