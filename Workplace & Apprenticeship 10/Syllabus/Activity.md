# Brain Pathways Activity

## Outcome

* Student understand that thinking in new ways is hard, but rewarding

## Resources

* Box of dirt
* water
* plant

## Start

* Water flows down a path
* But if we wanted to change that path to water the plant
* it requires more work, more effort
* But in the end, we get something better
* you are all plants, you are growing, and sometimes the way your brain has developed up to this point is not how it should be thinking
* we're humans, we live in sin, and we desire easy ways out of hard decisions
* Math is hard decisions, hard thinking, hard rationalizations
* But Math teaches us how to think
* teaches us how to see the world differently
* Christ saw the world differently, and because of His sacrifice, changed the world.
* I believe God has given us minds, and we are the stewards of those minds
* let us begin a semester of changing minds
* go into syllabus
