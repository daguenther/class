# Big Idea

We use measurement every day in the world. It is an essential part of food, computers, and almost anything else you can think of. We will work with both the SI system and the imperial system, and learn to convert between the two.

# Project

Design a Home using computer software, calculating total surface area and volume in both the Imperial system and the metric system.

Note: your house must be livable: as in, one room is generally not considered to be a home
