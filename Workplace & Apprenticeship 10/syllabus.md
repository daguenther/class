While attendance and interaction in class are not marked, I can guarantee you that showing up to class and being attentive will result in a higher grade on your mark, because you will be learning.

## Quiz

Every Friday will be a quiz, summarizing what has been learned throughout the week. The quiz will be a maximum of 20 minutes each week, and will happen at the later part of the class.

The quizzes will follow the curriculum for assessment.

Each question on the quiz will be worth 3 marks.

### Quiz Grade

0 |Nothing
1 |+ Right Equations
2 |+ Right Steps
3 |+ Right Answer

Questions on the quizzes will be sorted according to content type. Similar questions will be asked multiple times in order for the student to show achievement. The best grade will be taken.

### Example

On my first quiz I got 1 out of 3 on the Pythagorean theorem, but did well on the other questions. The next quiz was the opposite, I did well on the Pythagorean theorem, but didn't do so well on the others. In this case, the highest grade will be taken from each section of the 2 quizzes, to give the student the highest possible grade.

### Preparing for Quizzes

As you may have noticed by now, there are not assignments in this class. The only thing you will be marked on is your projects and your quizzes. However, if your grade in this class will greatly increased if you practice with assignments. At times I will give out questions to practice with, and then review them on the board. You are not obligated to do this, but if you refuse to work on them, your grades in this class will suffer.

Additionally, anyone who's grade is a **D** will have these assignments be mandatory. Failure to turn in an assignment will result in a

## Projects

Projects are meant to be real life applications for using math. Each project will be in the form of a question

It is then your task to find the answer. Initially I will give you a lot of direction, but as the semester continues you will need to provide your own direction in order to complete these projects.

### Example
How many baseballs would fit in a baseball diamond?

Judging from your current income and expenses, how long before you reach 1 million dollars?
