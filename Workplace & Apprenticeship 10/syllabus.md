While attendance and interaction in class are not marked, I can guarantee you that showing up to class and being attentive will result in a higher grade on your mark, because you will be learning.

## Quiz

Every Friday will be a quiz, summarizing what has been learned throughout the week. The quiz will be 30 minutes each week, and will happen at the later part of the class.

The quizzes will follow the curriculum for assessment.

Each question on the quiz will be worth 3 marks.

Mark | Translation
-----|-----
0 |"I didn't write anything related to the topic"
1 |"I did something related to the topic, but wasn't able to solve it"
2 |"I started out well, but wasn't able to get the right answer"
3 |"Understands and applies all knowledge correctly"

Questions on the quizzes will be sorted according to content type. Similar questions will be asked multiple times in order for the student to show achievement. The best grade will be taken.

Example: On my first quiz I got 1 out of 3 on the Pythagorean theorem, but did well on the other questions. The next quiz was the opposite, I did well on the Pythagorean theorem, but didn't do so well on the others. In this case, the highest grade will be taken from each section of the 2 quizzes, to give the student the highest possible grade.
