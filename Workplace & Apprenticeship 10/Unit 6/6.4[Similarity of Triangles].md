% Unit 6
% 6.4 Similarity of Triangles
% David Guenther

# Preamble

## Objective

Understand basic terminology for similar triangles, and be able to identify similarities between polygons.

# Start

## Intro

We use all the same properties that we used before on polygons to extend to triangles, with an important rule added in. Triangles must aways have 180 degrees, or pi in radians.

> Q: So based on this information, how much information do we need before we can establish that two triangles are congruent?

Work with a partner to try and see if you can discover the conditions that make any triangle similar to another (as in, what do they have to have in common before they are similar?)
