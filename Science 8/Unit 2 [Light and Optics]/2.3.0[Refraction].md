# Objective

**OP8.2** Explore properties and applications of optics-related technologies, including concave and convex mirrors and lenses

# Refraction

## Demonstration

Materials:
* Light emitters (Optics Box)
* Box of different lenses (Optics Box)

### Predict

Set up the light sources for different stations around the room. Use mirror kits provided from Regina Public. Kids will use the light paths to make predictions about how the light will bend?

[Prediction Handout]

### Observe

Kids will find the relationship that different lenses have on the path of light.

### Explain

As the light enteres the new medium it slows down. Show ray diagram, emphasizing how the first light waves to hit the new medium slow down before the others, causing a shift in direction.

## Definitions

1. **Refracton**: It happens when light travels from one substance into another
2. **Refractive Index**: How much the speed of light slows down in the medium
3. **Mirage**: wet apperance because of the disturbance of light due to heat
4.**lens**: an opject that changes the path of light by being curved on at least one side
