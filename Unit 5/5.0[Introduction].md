% 5.0 Introduction
% David Guenther

# Big Idea

Angles is the doorway to one of my favorite subject in mathematics, geometry. Angles are used constantly, and are everywhere in a 3D plane.

We are essentially working with two surfaces, and we want to know a relationship between two surfaces. This relationship has implications for science (how fast will a ball roll down a hill), engineering (will these two support structures ever meet), and life in general(will I get to the other railway track if I keep walking ;).

# Project

Using the methods found in this unit: find two surfaces you assume to be parallel, and check if they are indeed parallel.
