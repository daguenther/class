## Intro

Volume is a lot like length, sort of. It works in another dimension, but the steps we used will be repeated as we approach this.

## Volume

First we have to understand what volume is. It is essentially height, length, and depth, all taken into account to find the volume. For a cube, this is simply all 3 sides multiplied together. Notice that because we are multiplying a unit 3 times, our answer will be in some unit cubed.

A litre is defined to be just that. A box that is 10 cm long, 10 cm wide, and 10 cm deep.

So $$1 litre =  10^{-3} m^{3}$$

There are 1000 milli(latin for thousand)litres in one litre. We can use this knowledge to convert between the two.

However, the imperial system once again is not that simple.

* There are 16 ounces in one pint
* 2 pints equals 1 quart
* and 4 quarts equals 1 gallon.

Given that we know 1 Liter = 33.8140226 ounces, as an exercise, figure out the rest.

### Dry and wet

When looking up this information, remember that there are dry conversions, and wet conversions. This is because when cooking a dry amount of material takes up less room then a wet counterpart (due to wet taking up all the extra room dry cannot)
