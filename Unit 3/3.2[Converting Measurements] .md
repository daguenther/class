# Objective

Understand how to work between multiple measurement systems

# Start

## Intro

It would be much simpler if everyone used the same measurement system, or if everyone spoke the same language, or if everyone ran linux, but we live in a fallen world, and part of that is that man seeks to do things their own way.

And yes there is beauty in diversity, but unfortunately for you students, it means a lot more work

## Proportional Reasoning

Remember rates from Unit 1? Essentially we're doing something very similar. We are comparing two things of different units in a fraction.

Last class I partially introduced it, with 2.54 cm in 1 inch.

But we can do that for more of the measurements:

Now if we can remember this one conversion, we can figure out any length!

We know that 1 inch = 2.54 cm

We also know that 12 inches = 1 foot.

So if we multiply 2.54 by 12, we get 30.48 cm in one foot, or 0.3048 meters (remember: centi-meters)

and if we wanted to go the other way around, from 1 cm to inches, we would just change the formula

Instead of $$\frac{2.54 cm}{1 inch}$$, we would have $$\frac{1 inch}{2.54 cm}$$, or 0.393700787 inches in 1 cm.

But why stop here, try and figure out the rest on your own!

Find:

* mm to in
* m to feet
* m to yards
* km to mile
* in to mm
* yards to m
* mile to km
